### Decision

### Rationale

- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]

## Guidelines

- **When to create an ADR:** Create a decision record for significant architectural choices, technology selections, pattern implementations, or any decision that has long-term implications for the project.
- **Status definitions:**
  - **Proposed:** Decision has been suggested but not yet approved
  - **Accepted:** Decision has been reviewed and approved
  - **Deprecated:** Decision is no longer recommended but not officially replaced
  - **Superseded by ADR-XXX:** Decision has been replaced by another decision
- **Naming:** Number decisions sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.)
- **Reviews:** All ADRs should be reviewed and approved by relevant team members before being marked as Accepted
- **Updates:** When circumstances change, update the status rather than deleting the record to maintain project history
